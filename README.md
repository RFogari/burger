# Eat the Burger #

### Overview

The objective was to create a burger logger application using MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a custom ORM.  The application was designed using MVC design pattern.

### To Begin

Eat the burger is a restaurant app that lets users submit the name of a burger that they would like to eat.  When a new burger is submitted, the burger is added to the available list. The burger then becomes available to be devoured.

Click the devour button on each available burger.  The burger will move from the burgers available list to the burgers devoured list.
